# 🧠 JavaScript Array Practice Tasks

This project contains 20 beginner-friendly JavaScript array practice problems. Each task demonstrates the use of array methods, loops, conditionals, and basic input handling.

## 📋 Tasks Covered

1. Create an array of 5 numbers and use a `for` loop to print the **sum**.
2. Make an array of cities. Use `push()` to add 2 cities and print the updated array.
3. Make an array of 4 fruits. Use `pop()` to remove the last fruit and print it.
4. Use `shift()` on `[5, 10, 15, 20]` to remove the first element and print the result.
5. Create an array of programming languages. Use `unshift()` to add a language at the beginning.
6. Ask the user for a number and check if it exists in an array using `includes()`.
7. Use `indexOf()` to find the index of `"banana"` in a fruits array.
8. Create an array of numbers. Use a `for` loop to print values at even indexes.
9. Use `slice()` to copy the first 3 letters of an array of alphabets.
10. Use `splice()` to remove 2 names from a student array starting from index 1.
11. Use a `while` loop to find and print the **largest** number in an array.
12. Use a `for` loop to print only animal names that contain the letter `'a'`.
13. Use `splice()` to replace 2 elements in a color array from index 1.
14. Use a `do...while` loop to print all **odd numbers** from 1 to 20.
15. Use `push()` and `unshift()` to add mobile brands to an array and print the final array.
16. Use a `for` loop to count how many numbers in an array are **greater than 100**.
17. Ask the user for a name and check if it exists in the array using `includes()` with `if...else`.
18. Use a `for` loop to count how many numbers are **even** and how many are **odd**.
19. Use `slice()` to extract `["tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"]` from the week array.
20. Use `splice()` to remove the **middle element** from a number array and insert a new one instead.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Option 1: Run in Browser
1. Open `index.html` or the main HTML file containing the `<script>` section.
2. Right-click → Inspect → Go to **Console tab** to view all outputs.

### Option 2: Run in Repl.it, JSFiddle, CodePen, or Live Server
- Just paste the JS code into the **console** or editor.
- If the code contains `prompt()`, make sure it's run in a browser.

## 📚 Purpose

This project is intended for beginners to practice JavaScript arrays, loops, and basic input/output operations. It builds understanding of common array methods like:
- `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`
- `includes()`, `indexOf()`, `slice()`, `splice()`
- `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops
